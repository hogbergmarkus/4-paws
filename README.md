# 4 Paws  

4 Paws is a non-profit organization, with the goal that all cats and dogs, should be able to find their forever home.
The website is primarily aimed at private individuals, who for some reason do not have the possibility to keep their pet.

The website is useful for both dog and cat owners who need help relocating their pet,
as well as for people who feel strongly for animals and want to donate or sign up for volunteering.

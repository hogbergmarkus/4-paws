# 4 Paws  

4 Paws is a non-profit organisation, with the goal that all cats and dogs, should be able to find their forever home.

The website is primarily aimed at private individuals, who are looking to adopt a cat or dog.

Since 4 Paws is a non-profit organisation, donations and volunteers are highly important.

The website is also useful for both dog and cat owners, who need help relocating their pet.

# 4 Paws

![Am I responsive screenshot](documentation/screenshots/am-i-responsive-screenshot1.png)

## Introduction

[4 Paws](https://hogbergmarkus.github.io/4-paws/) "https://hogbergmarkus.github.io/4-paws/" is a fictional website, aiming to mimic a non-profit organisation, with the goal that all cats and dogs should be able to find their forever home.

The website is primarily aimed at private individuals, who are looking to adopt a cat or dog.

Since 4 Paws is a non-profit organisation, donations and volunteers are highly important.

The website is also useful for both dog and cat owners, who need help relocating their pet.

## User goals and stories

### Goals of the website business owner

- The goals of the owner is to find new homes for cats and dogs in need.

- To attract donations and volunteers.

- To help if someone is unable to keep their pet.

### Goals of the user

- The user wants to easily view animals available for adoption.

- Easy navigation between pages is important.

- Being able to view the contents of the website on different devices.

- The form for adopting a pet must be easy to understand and fill out.

### User stories

#### Business owner

As the owner of 4 Paws, I want to reach more people to increase chance of adoption.

I want a way to show poeople how they can help, and get in touch with us.

#### General user

As a general user I expect to find links to social media for news and updates.

I also want easy navigation to the "cats & dogs" page, to view potential pets to adopt.

#### New user

As a new user, I expect it to be easy to read some information about 4 Paws.

I also expect easy navigation on the website.

## Design

### Wireframes

Here you will find the link to my wireframes from the design phase.

[Wireframes](https://github.com/hogbergmarkus/4-paws/tree/main/documentation/wireframes)

### Fonts

The fonts chosen were "Lato" and a backup sans-serif.

Lato was chosen because it is easy to read, and it has a friendly look.

sans-serif is a great backup because of its wide support across devices and browsers.

### Colors

Background color chosen for the body is an off white (#f2f6f5). It was chosen because it feels nicer to the eyes than a perfectly white background.

A dark green rgb(2, 73, 37), was chosen for the header and footer. It gives some needed contrast, and it also goes along well with almost any color next to itself.

The hero banner is set to rgba(2, 73, 37, 0.8), same as the header and footer, but with some opacity for visual effect, wich makes it pleasing to look at.

Borders are also green, rgb(2, 73, 37). They give a good sense of where the different sections are on the main page.

On dark green backgrounds the text is white, and on white backgrounds the text is black, this to keep a good contrast between text and background.

Hover effects are orange, shown with the color rgb(229, 139, 12). It contrasts nicely with the pages generally green tones, and is visually pleasing.

The form on the applications page has a darker green tone to make the background less distracting.

### Images

Images, except the footprints image, were downloaded from [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/) and [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/), all images credited in the credits section.

The footprints image was created by me using the Bing chat AI [Bing.com](https://www.bing.com/).

They were optimized using the compressor tool on [Shortpixel.com](https://shortpixel.com/online-image-compression).

### Text

All text was written by myself.

## Features

### Existing features

#### Hero image

- The first thing your eyes will be drawn to is the circular hero image, with a banner asking if you want to adopt a pet.
- This is both visually appealing and directs the user towards the main objective the website, adoption of pets.
- The text banner for the image is also clickable, with a visual hover, and will take the user straight to the cats & dogs page.

![Hero image](documentation/screenshots/hero-image-screenshot.png)

#### Navigation bar

- Navigation bar in the top right of the screen that is accessible from all pages.
- On mobile, the navigation bar is a hamburger icon, to save screen realestate.
- On larger devices the navigation is always visible for easier navigation.
- The page that you are currently on, will be underlined to avoid confusion.
- The organisation logo is also clickable, and will take the user back to the home page.
- When you need to scroll on the page, the navigation bar will allways stay at the top of the screen, for easy navigation.
- As a whole this should make navigation on the website easy for users.

![Navigation area](documentation/screenshots/nav-area-screenshot.png)

#### Footprints image

- On the main page, on small screens, is an image of a dogs footprints across the screen, this should provide some enjoyment and a visual break from all the text.
- On larger screens, the image is placed above the footer instead, this is because it looked out of place in the middle of the screen.

![Footprints screenshot 1](documentation/screenshots/footprint-1-screenshot.png)

![Footprints screenshot 2](documentation/screenshots/footprint-2-screenshot.png)

#### Responsive links and form elements on larger screens

- A hover effect is added to link and input elements on larger screens, where you will use a mouse for navigation.
- This helps users visually to understand that they are hovering something they can interact with.

![Hover effect 1](documentation/screenshots/hover-screenshot-1.png)

![Hover effect 2](documentation/screenshots/hover-screenshot-2.png)

#### Links on the page

- There is a link to Facebook, in the contribute section on the main page, with aria-label, that will open in a new tab.
- This will be of service to users that come across information in the text, and want to go straight to Facebook without extra steps.

![Link in text to Facebook](documentation/screenshots/link-on-page-screenshot.png)

#### Cats & Dogs page

- This is the page where users can view what animals are available for adoption.
- It is important that the user gets a good experience on this page, no matter device, since we want them to stay, and the page is highly responsive as it should.

![Animals on desktop view](documentation/screenshots/animal-large-screenshot.png)

![Animals on wide view](documentation/screenshots/animal-wide-screenshot.png)

#### Applications page

- This page contains an applications form, which is important to the users that want to adopt a pet, or get help to relocate their own pet.

- Elements have a hover effect on larger screens, to help users visually.

- The form will prompt the user if they missed a field, or did not fill it correctly.

- If all fields are filled correctly, you will get an answer in return with information entered, example shown in this picture:

![Responsive form elements](documentation/screenshots/form-missing-screenshot.png)

![Formdump](documentation/screenshots/formdump.png)

#### Footer

- The footer contains links to social media, all with aria-labels, and opens in a new tab.

- This is useful to users who want to follow 4-paws actively, and see updates on activities.

![Footer screenshot](documentation/screenshots/footer-links-screenshot.png)

### Features to add inte the future

- In the Cats & Dogs section, each animals picture should be clickable, to be able to view more information on that individual.

- From each animals individual info page, there should be a link that takes you straight to the adoption form, with some pre-filled fields relating to that animal.

- Adoption and relocation forms should be separate.

## Bugs

Bug 1:

![Bug 1](documentation/screenshots/bug-1.png)

The green banner on the hero image should have rounded corners.

However the div that the banner is placed inside, stretches in a way that makes rounded corners not work.

Bug 2:

![Bug 2](documentation/screenshots/bug-2.png)

Found during manual testing. The header is too close to the hero image.

### Unfixed bugs

I have not found any bugs that I was unable to issue a fix for.

### Fixed bugs

Bug 1 has been patched, and element now has rounded corners.
